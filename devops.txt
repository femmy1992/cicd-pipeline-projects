##### Version Control System
# 3 types 
1. Local - A local version control system is a local database located on your local computer, in which every file change is stored as a patch. 
Every patch set contains only the changes made to the file since its last version. In order to see what the file looked like at any given moment, 
it is necessary to add up all the relevant patches to the file in order until that given moment.
The main problem with this is that everything is stored locally.
Also, collaborating with other developers or a team is very hard or nearly impossible.
2. Centralized - A centralized version control system has a single server that contains all the file versions. 
This enables multiple clients to simultaneously access files on the server, pull them to their local computer or push them onto the server from their local computer. 
This way, everyone usually knows what everyone else on the project is doing. Administrators have control over who can do what.
This allows for easy collaboration with other developers or a team.
The biggest issue with this structure is that everything is stored on the centralized server. 
If something were to happen to that server, nobody can save their versioned changes, pull files or collaborate at all
3. Distributed - With distributed version control systems, clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files from the server, 
they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, everyone collaborating on a project owns a local copy of the whole project, 
i.e. owns their own local database with their own complete history. With this model, if the server becomes unavailable or dies, 
any of the client repositories can send a copy of the project's version to any other client or back onto the server when it becomes available.
Git is the most well-known example of distributed version control systems.

###### SDLC #####

- stages of SDLC
1. Code - Git 
2. Build - Maven/Gradle 
3. Test - SonarQube/Selenium
4. Artifacts Storage - Nexus (monolithic app) or Dockerhub (image)
5. Deploy - Ansible/chef/puppet/salt/Kubernetes/Docker
6. Monitor - i.e. infrastructure and application monitoring -/ Prometheus(gather matrices)/ Grafana (visualization) amd Splunk(logging)
- integration with Jenkins 

- Artifacts 
1. Monolithic like WAR 
2. Containerizes like image 

## Build ###
- Maven - it is a Java based software. 
Maven is actually a plugin execution framework where every task is actually done by plugins. 
Maven Plugins are generally used to −
	• create jar file
	• create war file
	• compile code files
	• unit testing of code
	• create project documentation
create project reports
- Maven Architecture: Build process -
1. Action --> POM file - all action are declared in the pom.xml file (project Object model)
2. Test - unit test i.e. test all the codes for any error. and integration test i.e. the connection btw all the features and if the code is deployable - tool like J-unit 
3. Source Code - stored in repo with path declared in pom.xml
4. dependencies - like JDK for java application or python for python applications. they are also declared at the level of pom.xml files
5. Report - maven will generate report throughout the build process. it can be used for debugging 
6. Application Artifact - they have extentions like .war (web application Resources, used to package web applications ), .jar file (database application), .ear file for enterprise
- An EAR file is a critical piece in deploying a service application to a production server. 
An enterprise archive (EAR) file is a compressed file that contains the libraries, enterprise beans, and JAR files that the application requires for deployment.

# Project Object Model - pom file 
- declare your build objectives 
1. dependencies management  - pry and transitive dependencies 
2. pluggins 
3. build scope - compiler and time frame.

# dependencies Management 
- Repostory during maven build process
1. Maven Central repo  - maven managed 
2. Remote repo - cx managed (developers responsibility) e.g. s3, github,etc.
3. Local Cache - any dependencies from central repo will be downloaded on your local repo
and for fast build. 

## Project Build ###  - https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html | https://www.tutorialspoint.com/maven/maven_build_life_cycle.htm
# Maven Lifecycles types - most organization use build and clean.
-  build/ default lifecycle phases (important ones): allows you to package app and get artifacts.
1. Validate phase - check for configurations, syntax error, dependencies of a pon.xml and artifacts version
2. Compile phase - the structure of the source code. java application must follow certain structure. 
3. Test phase - run unit test case and integration test case. it use J-unt test cases for the testing
4. Package phase - it make sure that integration btw dependencies and souce code are package into a single file.
 and executable format like .jar, .ear, .war. 
 a. maven will create a target directory for reports, jar, war or ear file, and unit test report
 b. verify and install before deploy.
5. deploy phase - publish artifacts to storage like Nexus. command is mvn.
-  clean: The Maven Clean Plugin, as the name implies, attempts to clean the files and directories generated by Maven during its build. 
          While there are plugins that generate additional files, the Clean Plugin assumes that these files are generated inside the target directory.

# Maven Pluggins 

# Maven Build processes - POM file - repo - lib/dependencies repo - test script - artifacts - build report - documentation.


## Application Testing 
- types of Application Test 
1. SCA - Software Composition Analysis: evaluations some code based on dependencies and libraries used when packaging the application
   a. check for dependencies 
   b. check for SQL Injections 
   c. License i.e govt compliance 
2. SAST - Software Application Static Test - SonarQube, 
    a. there is no artifact executon here i.e. no deployment of artifact
    b. 
3. DAST - Dynamic Application Security Testing - Selenium
    a. it gives the ability to execute the artifact generated and be able to see the app on the browser
    b. more expensive with a lot of effort
- major component of test - dynamic and static test 

- SonarQube: 
    a. used for static code analysis 
    b. integrate well with many CI tools like Jenkins, maven. 
    c. app deployment could be Linux or Windows environment. 
- SonarQube Architecture:
    a. Sonarqube web server - allows you to have visual at your browser (UI composition) to see all report(analysis, bugs, vulnerabilities etc). 
        - configuration - tokens, user, project or integration
    b. SonarQube database - actual storage layer to store result of analysis performed on the app code. 
        - support SQL database e.g oracle, mysql, ms sql server and postgresql.
    c. elastic search - analysis of data at near real time. 
    d. SonarQube Scanner - determined by the build tool you are making use of for your project. 
        - maven, gradle, Ant, and MS build Scanner.

- SonarQube Rules: 
    a. code smell - best practices when developing application codes. copy code from actual libraries
    b. bug analysis - past experience, amount of bugs that could be accomodated.
    c. vulnerability rules - api keys, secrets, database credentials
    d. Security hot spot - it causes a huge alert when identified like database credential or app keys

- SonarQube Issues:
    a. based on Severities 
        - Blocker - it must be fixed b4 app is moved to production
        - Critical - it is manageable but not healthy. app may run but it wont perform optimally. 
                     e.g. if it is vulnerable enough for sql inh=jection
        - major - e.g quality of the code like duplicate of codes or size of the code base. 
        - minor - like lines seperating blockes of code, lack of proper indentation strategies, etc. 

- Quality Gate - it defines how many known bugs should be tolerated/accomodated before the implementation can be term successful (benchmark)








Summary based on my own understanding so Far...
SDLC stages:
1. Version control system (VCS) - git 
2. Build - Maven
3. Test - Sonarqube/ Selenium
4. Artifacts Storage - Nexus (monolithic app) or dockerhub (microservices)
5. Deploy - Ansible, puppet, chef, docker, kubernetes, salt, etc.
6. Monitoring - application and infrastructure monitoring 
   - Prometheus(gather matrices)/ Grafana (visualization) amd Splunk(logging)
** Jenkins for Integration.


1. VCS - 3 types:
    a. Local - your computer
    b. centralized - e.g S3 bucket
    c. Distributed - git (github as storage)

2. Build
- Maven build processes:
    a. action - POM file 
    b. test - unit or integration test 
    c. Source code - repository 
    d. Libraries/dependencies 
    e. reports 
    f. application artifacts - war, jar, ear 
    g. documentation.

- maven Build lifecycle phases
i. build/default:
    a. validated phase
    b. compile phase
    c. test phase 
    d. package phase 
    e. deploy phase 
ii. clean 

3. Test - I guess this is where we are now 

##### Hands-On ######
1. laumch EC2 and ssh 
2. install apache mavenn - maven installtion lib doess not exit in /etc/yum.repos.d (which is the eosystem of yum package)
    then you have to download apache-maven in the yum lib before installing maven.
    wget - is a linux utility used to donload any app in linux. 
3. install Java 8 for Maven
4. install default runtime for Java 8 for 1.8
5. install java 8 compiler 1.18
6. verify maven with mvn -v 
7. install git, switch branch with checkout 
8. switch to the root directory of the app with src and pom.xml
9. mvn validate and mvn compile 
10. mvn clean - just to delete all data generated, so we can set a stage for the mvn test 
11. mvn test / mvn clean 
12. mvn package - to get artifact
